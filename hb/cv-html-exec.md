Absolutely — I can create a **designer‑style executive résumé layout** for you, complete with:

✔️ Professional color theme (Purple executive palette)\
✔️ Clean, modern layout\
✔️ Placeholder for a profile photo\
✔️ Sidebar design for contact + skills\
✔️ Main content area for summary, experience, achievements, etc.

### **Format Options**

You can choose any (or all) of these:

1.  **HTML** (best for printing to PDF / styling / future editing)
2.  **Word (.docx)** — I can generate it using Python if you want
3.  **PDF** — also possible via Python
4.  **Markdown** styled like a designer layout
5.  **HTML + CSS bundled together** (full template)

Most people prefer **HTML**, because:

*   It’s easy to style with CSS
*   Looks extremely professional when printed to PDF
*   Editable in any code editor
*   Supports colors, columns, images, and layout features
